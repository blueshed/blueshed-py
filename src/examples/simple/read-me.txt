To run this you'll need to call: bower init
in the www/static folder - this will execute the bower.json
and load all the dependancies.

You'll need to add the blueshed-py/src directory to your PYTHONPATH

    then call python -m simple.web
    or python web.py
    
    to run in debug mode add --debug=yes
